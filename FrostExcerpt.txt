INTO MY OWN 


One of my wishes is that those dark trees. 

So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze, 

Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom, 

But stretched away unto the edge of doom. 

I should not be withheld but that some day 
Into their vastness I should steal away, 

Fearless of ever finding open land, 

Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand. 

I do not see why I should e'er turn back, 

Or those should not set forth upon my track 
To overtake me, who should miss me here 
And long to know if still I held them dear. 

They would not find me changed from him they 
knew 

Only more sure of all I thought was true.

GHOST HOUSE 


I dwell in a lonely house I know 
That vanished many a summer ago, 

And left no trace but the cellar walls, 

And a cellar in which the daylight falls, 

And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow. 

O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield 
The woods come back to the mowing field; 

The orchard tree has grown one copse 
Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops; 
The footpath down to the well is healed. 

I dwell with a strangely aching heart 
In that vanished abode there far apart 
On that disused and forgotten road 
That has no dust-bath now for the toad. 

Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart; 

The whippoorwill is coming to shout 
And hush and cluck and flutter about: 

I hear him begin far enough away 
Full many a time to say his say 
Before he arrives to say it out. 


5 



It is under the small, dim, summer star. 

I know not who these mute folk are 
Who share the unlit place with me 

Those stones out under the low-limbed tree 
Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar. 

They are tireless folk, but slow and sad. 
Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad, 
With none among them that ever sings. 
And yet, in view of how many things. 

As sweet companions as might be had.

MY NOVEMBER GUEST 


My Sorrow, when she's here with me, 
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain 
Are beautiful as days can be; 

She loves the bare, the withered tree; 

She walks the sodden pasture lane. 

Her pleasure will not let me stay. 

She talks and I am fain to list: 

She's glad the birds are gone away. 

She's glad her simple worsted grey 
Is silver now with clinging mist. 

The desolate, deserted trees. 

The faded earth, the heavy sky, 

The beauties she so truly sees. 

She thinks I have no eye for these, 

And vexes me for reason why. 

Not yesterday I learned to know 
The love of bare November days 
Before the coming of the snow. 

But it were vain to tell her so. 

And they are better for her praise. 



LOVE AND A QUESTION 


A Stranger came to the door at eve' 

And he spoke the bridegroom fair. 

He bore a green- white stick in his hand, 
And, for all burden, care. 

He asked with the eyes more than the lips 
For a shelter for the night. 

And he turned and looked at the road afar 
Without a window light. 

The bridegroom came forth into the porch 
With Tet us look at the sky. 

And question what of the night to be. 
Stranger, you and I.' 

The woodbine leaves littered the yard' 
The woodbine berries were blue. 
Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind; 
'Stranger, I wish I knew.' 

Within, the bride in the dusk alone 
Bent over the open fire. 

Her face rose-red with the glowing coal 
And the thought of the heart's desire. 
The bridegroom looked at the weary road. 
Yet saw but her within. 

And wished her heart in a case of gold 
And pinned with a silver pin. 


8 



The bridegroom thought it little to give 
A dole of bread, a purse, 

A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God, 
Or for the rich a curse; 

But whether or not a man was asked 
To mar the love of two 
By harboring woe in the bridal house, 
The bridegroom wished he knew.

STARS 


How countlessly they congregate 
O'er our tumultuous snow', 

Which flows in shapes as tall as trees 
When wintry winds do blow!  

As if with keenness for our fate. 

Our faltering few steps on 
To white rest, and a place of rest 
Invisible at dawn,  

And yet with neither love nor hate. 
Those stars like some snow-white 
Minerva's snow-white marble eyes 
Without the gift of sight. 


lO 



STORM FEAR 


When the wind works against us in the dark, 

And pelts with snow 

The lower chamber window on the east. 

And whispers with a sort of stifled bark, 

, The beast, 

Come out! Come outf- 
it costs no inward struggle not to go. 

Ah, no! 

I count our strength. 

Two and a child. 

Those of us not asleep subdued to mark 
How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length, 
How drifts are piled, 

Dooryard and road ungraded. 

Till even the comforting barn grows far away. 
And my heart owns a doubt 
Whether 'tis in us to arise with day 
And save ourselves unaided. 


11 



TO THE THAWING WIND 


Come with rain, O loud Southwesterl 
Bring the singer, bring the nester; 

Give the buried flower a dream; 

Make the settled snow-bank stream; 
Find the brown beneath the white; 

But whatever you do to-night. 

Bathe my window, make it flow. 

Melt it as the ice will go; 

Melt the glass and leave the sticks 
Like a hermit's crucifix; 

Burst into my narrow stall; 

Swing the picture on the wall; 

Run the rattling pages o'er; 

Scatter poems on the floor; 

Turn the poet out of door. 


12 



A PRAYER IN SPRING 


Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day; 
And give us not to think so far away 
As the uncertain harvest; keep us here 
All simply in the springing of the year. 

Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white. 
Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; 
And make us happy in the happy bees. 

The swarm dilating round the perfect trees. 

And make us happy in the darting bird 
That suddenly above the bees is heard. 

The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill. 
And off a blossom in mid air stands still. 

For this is love and nothing else is love. 

The which it is reserved for God above 
To sanctify to what far ends He will. 

But which it only needs that we fulfil. 


13 



FLOWER-GATHERING 


I left you in the morning;, 

And in the morning glow. 

You walked a way beside me 
To make me sad to go. 

Do you know me in the gloaming, 

Gaunt and dusty grey with roaming? 

Are you dumb because you know me not. 
Or dumb because you know? 

All for me? And not a question 
For the faded flowers gay 
That could take me from beside you 
For the ages of a day? 

They are yours, and be the measure 
Of their worth for you to treasure. 

The measure of the little while 
That IVe been long away.

ROSE POGONIAS 


A saturated meadow, 

Sun-shaped and jewel-small, 

A circle scarcely wider 

Than the trees around were tall; 
Where winds were quite excluded. 
And the air was stifling sweet 
With the breath of many flowers, 

A temple of the heat. 

There we bowed us in the burning. 

As the sun's right worship is. 

To pick where none could miss them 
A thousand orchises; 

For though the grass was scattered. 

Yet every second spear 
Seemed tipped with wings of color. 
That tinged the atmosphere. 

We raised a simple prayer 
Before we left the spot. 

That in the general mowing 
That place might be forgot; 

Or if not all so favoured. 

Obtain such grace of hours. 

That none should mow the grass there 
While so confused with flowers. 


15 



WAITING 


AFIELD AT DUSK 

That things for dream there are when spectre-like, 
Moving among tall haycocks lightly piled, 

I enter alone upon the stubble field. 

From which the laborers' voices late have died. 

And in the antiphony of afterglow 
And rising full moon, sit me down 
Upon the full moon's side of the first haycock 
And lose myself amid so many alike. 

I dream upon the opposing lights of the hour, 
Preventing shadow until the moon prevail; 

I dream upon the night-hawks peopling heaven. 
Each circling each with vague unearthly cry, 

Or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar; 

And on the bat's mute antics, who would seem 
Dimly to have made out my secret place. 

Only to lose it when he pirouettes. 

And seek it endlessly with purblind haste; 

On the last swallow's sweep; and on the rasp 
In the abyss of odor and rustle at my back, 
That,'silenced by my advent, finds once more, 

After an interval, his instrument. 

And tries once-'twice and thrice if I be there; 

And on the worn book of old-golden song 
I brought not here to read, it seems, but hold 

16 



And freshen in this air of withering sweetness; 

But on the memory of one absent most, 

For whom these lines when they shall greet her eye. 


17 



IN NEGLECT 


1 hey leave us so to the way we took, 

As two in whom they were proved mistaken. 
That we sit sometimes in the wayside nook, 
With mischievous, vagrant, seraphic look. 

And try if we cannot feel forsaken. 



THE VANTAGE POINT 


If tired of trees I seek again mankind, 

Well I know where to hie me in the dawn, 
To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn. 
There amid lolling juniper reclined. 

Myself unseen, I see in white defined 
Far off the homes of men, and farther still. 
The graves of men on an opposing hill. 
Living or dead, whichever are to mind. 

And if by noon I have too much of these, 

I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, 

The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow, 
My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, 

I smell the earth, I smell the bruised plant, 

I look into the crater of the ant. 


IQ 



MOWING 


There was never a sound beside the wood but one, 
And that was my long scythe whispering to the 
ground. 

What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself; 
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, 
Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound 

And that was why it whispered and did not speak. 

It was no dream of the gift of idle hours. 

Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf: 

Anything more than the truth would have seemed 
too weak 

To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows. 

Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers 
(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake. 

The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows. 

My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make. 


20 



GOING FOR WATER 


Th e well was dry beside the door, 

And so we went with pail and can 
Across the fields behind the house 
To seek the brook if still it ran; 

Not loth to have excuse to go, 

Because the autumn eve was fair 
(Though chill), because the fields were ours. 
And by the brook our woods were there. 

We ran as if to meet the moon 

That slowly dawned behind the trees, 

The barren boughs without the leaves, 
Without the birds, without the breeze. 

But once within the wood, we paused 
Like gnomes that hid us from the moon, 
Ready to run to hiding new 

With laughter when she found us soon. 

Each laid on other a staying hand 
To listen ere we dared to look. 

And in the hush we joined to make 

We heard, we knew we heard the brooks 


21 



A note as from a single place' 

A slender tinkling fall that made 
Now drops that floated on the pool 
Like pearls, and now a silver blade. 


22 



REVELATION 


We make ourselves a place apart ' ' 
Behind light words that tease and flout. 
But oh, the agitated heart 

Till someone find us really out. 

'Tis pity if the case require  * 

(Or so we say) that in the end 
We speak the literal to inspire 
The understanding of a friend. 

But so with all, from babes that play 
At hide-and-seek to God afar, 

So all who hide too well away 

Must speak and tell us where they are. 



THE TUFT OF FLOWERS 


I went to turn the grass once after one 
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun. 

The dew was gone that made his blade so keen 
Before I came to view the levelled scene. 

I looked for him behind an isle of trees; 

I listened for his whetstone on the breeze. 

But he had gone his way, the grass all mown, 

And I must be, as he had been, alone, 

*As all must be,' I said within my heart, 

Whether they work together or apart.' 

But as I said it, swift there passed me by 
On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly, 

Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night 
Some resting flower of yesterday's delight. 

And once I marked his flight go round and round. 
As where some flower lay withering on the ground. 

And then he flew as far as eye could see. 

And then on iremulous wing came back to me. 



I thought of questions that have no reply, 

And would have turned to toss the grass to dry; 

But he turned first, and led my eye to look 
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, 

A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared 
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared. 

I left my place to know them by their name. 

Finding them butterfly weed when I came. 

The mower in the dew had loved them thus, 

ft ' 

By leaving them to flourish, not for us. 

Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him. 

But from sheer morning gladness at the brim. 

The butterfly and I had lit upon. 

Nevertheless, a message from the dawn. 

That made me hear the wakening birds around, 
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground, 

And feel a spirit kindred to my own; 

So that henceforth I worked no more alone; 

But glad with him, I worked as with his aid. 

And weary, sought at noon with him the shade; 


25 





THE DEMIURGE'S LAUGH 


It was far in the sameness of the wood; 

I was running with joy on the Demon's trail. 
Though I knew what I hunted was no true god. 

It was just as the light was beginning to fail 
That I suddenly heard all I needed to hear: 

It has lasted me many and many a year. 

The sound was behind me instead of before, 

A sleepy sound, but mocking half, 

As of one who utterly couldn't care. 

The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh. 
Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went; 

And well I knew what the Demon meanti 

I shall not forget how his laugh rang out. 

I felt as a fool to have been so caught, 

And checked my steps to make pretence 
It was something among the leaves I sought 
(Though doubtful whether he stayed to see)* 
Thereafter I sat me against a tree. 


27 



A LINE-STORM SONG 


Th e line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift. 
The road is forlorn all day, 

Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift. 
And the hoof-prints vanish away. 

The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee. 
Expend their bloom in vain. 

Come over the hills and far with me. 

And be my love in the rain. 

The birds have less to say for themselves 
In the wood- world's torn despair 

Than now these numberless years the elves. 
Although they are no less there: 

All song of the woods is crushed like some 
Wild, easily shattered rose. 

Come, be my love in the wet woods, come. 
Where the boughs rain when it blows. 

There is the gale to urge behind 
And bruit our singing down. 

And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 
From which to gather your gown. 

What matter if we go clear to the west. 

And come not through dry-shod? 

For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 
The rain-fresh goldenrod. 


28 



Oh, never this whelming east wind swells 
But it seems like the sea's return 
To the ancient lands where it left the shells 
Before the age of the fern; 

And it seems like the time when after doubt 
Our love came back amain. 

Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 
And be my love in the rain. 


29 



OCTOBER 


O hushed October morning mild, 

Thy leaves have ripened to the fall; 
To-morrow's wind, if it be wild, 

Should waste them all. 

The crows above the forest call; 
To-morrow they may form and go. 

O hushed October morning mild, 

Begin the hours of this day slow. 

Make the day seem to us less brief. 

Hearts not averse to being beguiled. 
Beguile us in the way you know. 

Release one leaf at break of day; 

At noon release another leaf; 

One from our trees, one far away. 

Retard the sun with gentle mist; 

Enchant the land with amethyst. 

Slow, slow! 

For the grapes' sake, if they were all. 
Whose leaves already are burnt with frost. 
Whose clustered fruit must else be lost 
For the grapes' sake along the wall. 



RELUCTANCE 


Out through the fields and the woods 
And over the walls I have wended; 

I have climbed the hills of view 

And looked at the world, and descended 
I have come by the highway home, 

And lo, it is ended. 

The leaves are all dead on the ground, 

Save those that the oak is keeping 
To ravel them one by one 

And let them go scraping and creeping 
Out over the crusted snow, 

When others are sleeping. 

And the dead leaves lie huddled and still, 
No longer blown hither and thither; 
The last lone aster is gone; 

The flowers of the witch-hazel wither; 
The heart is still aching to seek. 

But the feet question Whither?' 

Ah, when to the heart of man 
Was it ever less than a treason 
To go with the drift of things. 

To yield with a grace to reason. 

And bow and accept the end 
Of a love or a season?

MENDING WALL 


Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 

That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, 

And spills the upper boulders in the sun; 

And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. 

The work of hunters is another thing: 

I have come after them and made repair 
Where they have left not one stone on a stone, 

But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, 

To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, 

No one has seen them made or heard them made, 
But at spring mending-time we find them there. 

I let my neighbour know beyond the hill; 

And on a day we meet to walk the line 
And set the wall between us once again. 

We keep the wall between us as we go. 

To each the boulders that have fallen to eacli. 

And some are loaves and some so nearly balls 
We have to use a spell to make them balance: 

'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!' 

We wear our fingers rough with handling them. 
Oh, just another kind of out-door game. 

One on a side. It comes to little more: 

There where it is we do not need the wall: 

He is all pine and I am apple orchard. 

My apple trees will never get across 
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. 

He only says, Good fences make good neighbours.' 


35 



Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder 
If I could put a notion in his head: 

'Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it 
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. 
Before I built a wall Fd ask to know 
What I was walling in or walling out, 

And to whom I was like to give offence. 

Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 

That wants it down.' I could say Tlves' to him, 

But it's not elves exactly, and Fd rather 
He said it for himself. I see him there 
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top 
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. 

He moves in darkness as it seems to me, 

Not of woods only and the shade of trees. 

He will not go behind his father's saying. 

And he likes having thought of it so well 

He says again, Good fences make good neighbours.'

THE DEATH OF THE HIRED MAN 


Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table 
Waiting for Warren, When she heard his step, 

She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage 
To meet him in the doorway with the news 
And put him on his guard. Silas is back.' 

She pushed him outward with her through the door 
And shut it after her. Be kind she said. 

She took the market things from Warren's arms 
And set them on the porch, then drew him down 
To sit beside her on the wooden steps, 

When was I ever anything but kind to him? 

But I'll not have the fellow back he said. 

I told him so last haying, didn't I? 

If he left then, I said, that ended it. 

What good is he? Who else will harbour him 
At his age for the little he can do? 

What help he is there's no depending on. 

Off he goes always when I need him most. 

He thinks he ought to earn a little pay. 

Enough at least to buy tobacco with, 

So he won't have to beg and be beholden. 

All right, I say, I can't afford to pay 
Any fixed wages, though I wish I could. 

Someone else can. Then someone else will 
have to. 

I shouldn't mind his bettering himself
